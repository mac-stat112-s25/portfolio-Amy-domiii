Use this file to generate a professional looking **quadvariate** visualization.  The visualization will not perfect the first time but you are expected to improve on it throughout the semester especially after covering advanced topics such as effective viz.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

weather <- read.csv("https://mac-stat.github.io/data/weather_3_locations.csv") |> 
  mutate(date = as.Date(date))  

head(weather)
```

```{r}
ggplot(weather, aes(y = temp3pm, x = temp9am, color = location, shape = raintoday)) + 
  geom_point()+
  labs(title = "Temperature Changes and Rain Occurence Differences by Locations",
       x = "Temperature at 9am(˚C)",
       y = "Temperature at 3pm(˚C)",
       color = "Rained Today",
       shape = "Location") 
```
