Use this file to generate a professional looking **bivariate** visualization.  The visualization will not perfect the first time but you are expected to improve it throughout the semester especially after covering advanced topics such as effective viz.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

elections <- read.csv("https://mac-stat.github.io/data/election_2020_county.csv")

head(elections)
```


```{r}
ggplot(elections, aes(x = repub_pct_20, fill = historical, color = historical)) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.4) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("blue", "purple", "red")) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("blue","purple","red")) +
  labs(title = "Density Distribution of Republican Voters in 2020 by Historical Voting Categories") +
  facet_wrap(~ historical)
```
