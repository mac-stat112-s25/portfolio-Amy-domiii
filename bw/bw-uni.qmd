Use this file to generate a professional looking **univariate** visualization. The visualization will not perfect the first time but you are expected to improve on it throughout the semester especially after covering advanced topics such as effective viz.

```{r}
hikes <- read.csv("https://mac-stat.github.io/data/high_peaks.csv")
head(hikes)
```

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r}
ggplot(hikes, aes(x = rating)) +
  geom_bar(fill = "orange") +
  labs(title = "The Number of Hikes of Different Ratings",
       x = "Rating", 
       y = "Number of Hikes") +
  theme_minimal()
```
